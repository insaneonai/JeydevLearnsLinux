## Jeydev Learns linux 🐧

A personal journey to deeply understand Linux by **rebuilding core Unix tools from scratch using pure C** and system calls — ultimately progressing toward writing a **mini shell**, **a scheduler**, and eventually **OS-level** components.

This project is inspired by the philosophy:

> “If you want to understand Linux, rebuild its tools.”
